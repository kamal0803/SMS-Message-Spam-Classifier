# SMS Message Spam Classifier

Developed a spam classifier model to classify spam SMS messages using the popular Naive Baye's algorithm from scratch.

## Approach
A spam classifier model was built to classify spam SMS messages using the popular Naive Baye's algorithm from scratch.

Out of 5572 data points, 3900 were considered for training & remaining 1672 for testing.

## Results & Conclusion
The model achieved a accuracy of 98.5 % on training data, while an accuracy of 97.48 % of testing data.

## Acknowledgements
Data used for building this model was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset & http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/
